# New VSCode Features
1.	Explore and Document THREE (3) major features of VSCode that will be helpful to a student in this course.
	a.	These can be plugins, debuggers, or built-in features that were not present in Atom
	b.	If you choose shortcuts and hotkeys that exist in Atom but are different, include a large variety of them as one “major feature”
2.	Documentation must use “Grandma Rules”, in that a user that has very little experience in technology should be able to learn from your documentation
	a.	Don’t assume the user has enough knowledge that you can skip basic steps
3.	Each major feature should take a half a page of solid text (no spacing or padding), and a full page using images
	a.	A picture is worth a thousand words
	b.	Invert the picture image if in Dark Mode, or switch to Light Mode before taking screenshots.
4.	Save the documentation in a Word Document with your full name as the filename, and save it in the VSCode_Docs folder of this DocPac
5.	Submit a PR to include your documentation in the DocPac repo main branch.
	a.	Do not submit other files in this PR
