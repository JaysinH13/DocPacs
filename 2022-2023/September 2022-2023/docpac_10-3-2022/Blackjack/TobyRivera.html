<!-- Alright Here's the deal. I have two versions of this I made and I'm writing this at 9:22 Pm after getting mad 
because the Sa2 mod loader would not work. And it reminded me of how much time I spent making this and the second draft to 
prove I actually know how to write it it's just well I'll get there. The doc you see now was first made as something nicer
but you asked me to scale it back so I did in the simpliest way I could. You see I can tell you exactly how this code works.
I'm 99 percent sure you can't just get the same card despite no checks because chances and just the way it's written doesn't
allow for that. This is based of a players system so depending on how many it's how the game will go.You can change this 
 Actually by heading into the code and typing a different number of players in there assuming theres a limit. The deafult is one because
you said not to worry about the dealer. Which is why typically you win so easily with this so it's not perfect but it's good
enough. No this was not "Stolen" off the internet I don't mean that to mock you or anything but I can comfirtably say this was 
not "stolen" off the internet. So just to prove to you I actually did try and just didn't heartlessly copy paste and I actually
know and understand what I'm doing I bring a second revision of this sight to be even simplier. This second revision has problems. 
For one I can't get rid of the syntax error that for whatever reason doesn't seem to go away no matter what I do despite the fact I
correctly put it in. On certain browsers this seems to act quite weird. What I mean is on safari the code worked fine even the stay
function worked despite me supposedly not defining the function correctly. But on chrome for whatever reason I can't get it to work 
despite ANYTHING I DO. Devices, from Blackberry phones, Windows OS's, VMS I TRIED EVERYTHING I SWEAR. Let me know if you can ever get
it to work on any other browser. Also I do know there are no Aces or kings or queen or jacks here but despite my efforts the code 
doesn't seem to respond to them for whatever reason. This isn't like android I can't use a raw folder to drag resources and I couldn't
figure out a way to put it in by myself so there's that unfortinate outcome. I could see why the stay function may not intially work since I didn't necesarily code it but why Hit
doesn't work is up to you because it probably should. Unless I just defined it wrong. Anways here's all of what I used and I'm going to 
get off commit and pull request to get ready for tommorow. I don't want to say I'M TIRED or anything because I'm sure you're more tired
than I will be at this age. Don't worry i you're reading this I figured out the github stuff. Enjoy!
